# V-Rising-Server-Manager---Chinese

## Information
Tool to install, update and run a V Rising Server on Windows OS. Also includes a game and server settings editor.


## Usage
### Installation
Read the [Wiki](https://github.com/Lacyway/V-Rising-Server-Manager/wiki/Initial-Setup) for more info.

Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Lacyway/V-Rising-Server-Manager/releases).

Extract the files to any folder. Run the program.

### Settings Editor
You can change the settings file using the 'Editors' on the right. Either load one or create a new one by filling the fields and then saving it to the save folder.
Example: `SaveData\Settings\ServerGameSettings.json` or `SaveData\Settings\ServerHostSettings.json`

### RCON
The application has a very primitive RCON console built in. If you have RCON enabled in your ServerHostSettings you can connect to it and run the commands on the right. Currently only 2 commands are implemented in the game.

Select a command and write the parameter in the text field at the bottom and click 'Send' to send the command to the server. No need to write the command.
